STOCK = "TSLA"
COMPANY_NAME = "Tesla Inc"
API = "9ZLZ5FCJ8XKKE2CS"

# STEP 1: Use Alpha Vantage API
my_parameters = {
    "function": "TIME_SERIES_DAILY",  # Request daily time series data
    "symbol": STOCK,  # Stock ticker symbol
    "apikey": API,  # Your API key
    "outputsize": "compact",  # Get 100 data points
    "datatype": "json"  # Response in JSON format
}

## STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").

url = 'https://www.alphavantage.co/query'
r = requests.get(url, params=my_parameters)
data = r.json()
# print(data)

# Check if the response contains the "Time Series (Daily)" data
if "Time Series (Daily)" in data:
    # Get the daily time series data
    time_series = data["Time Series (Daily)"]
    dates = list(time_series.keys())
    # print(time_series)
    # print(dates)



    # Get the two most recent trading days
    yesterday = dates[0]
    day_before_yesterday = dates[1]
    # print(yesterday)
    # print(day_before_yesterday)

    # Consolidated â†“â†“â†“â†“â†“
    # print(r.json().get("Time Series (Daily)").get(list(r.json().get("Time Series (Daily)").keys())[0]))








## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME. 

## STEP 3: Use https://www.twilio.com
